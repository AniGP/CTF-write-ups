Level 0 :
---------

Level Goal

The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.

To get to level 0 we need to simply SSH into Bandit with the username: bandit0 and password: bandit0

% ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org 2220


Level 0 → Level 1:
------------------

Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

% ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org 2220

% ls

% cat readme

boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1

Now, from here type exit and SSH back into the next level by running

% ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org

Remember, you must SSH into the next level after getting the password. So just replace the user name before the @ with the next level (Ex: bandit0@bandit.labs... will now be bandit1@bandit.labs..., and for the password, use what you attained from the previous level.


Level 1 → Level 2:
------------------

Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory

Commands you may need to solve this level

ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

We are told that the password is in a file called “-“. We need to delimit the dash to read it.

% ls -a
-  .  ..  .bash_logout  .bashrc  .profile

% cat ./-

Level 2 → Level 3:
------------------

Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory

Commands you may need to solve this level

ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

This time we simply need to read a file with spaces in it’s name. Let’s surround the file name in quotes.

% dir

spaces\ in\ this\ filename

% cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename

Level 3 → Level 4:
------------------

Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

Commands you may need to solve this level

ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

We are told the file we need is in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

% ls

inhere

% cd inhere

% ls -a

Level 4 → Level 5:
------------------

Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

Commands you may need to solve this level

ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

We are told the password is somewhere in the inhere directory and is the only human readable file in the directory. Let’s see what file types we have.

% ls -a

.  ..  .bash_logout  .bashrc  .profile  inhere

% cd inhere

% ls -a

Commands you may need to solve this level

ls, cd, cat, file, du, find, grep

This is similar to the previous, except we have some more file attributes to look for. As well as more files to look through.

Level 7 → Level 8:
------------------

Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth

Commands you may need to solve this level

grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth. We can pipe cat to grep for this.

% ls

data.txt

% cat data.txt | grep millionth

millionth       cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV


Level 8 → Level 9:
------------------

Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once

Commands you may need to solve this level

grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

Here we need to find a unique line among many. We can pipe a few commands together to do this. Note the commands do need to be in this order.

% ls -a

.  ..  .bash_logout  .bashrc  .profile  data.txt

% cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u

Commands you may need to solve this level

grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt among of few lines of human-readable strings starting with ‘=’ characters.

We can see our password string amongst our output.


Level 10 → Level 11:
--------------------

Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data

Commands you may need to solve this level

grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data. We need to decode the file.

% ls -a

.  ..  .bash_logout  .bashrc  .profile  data.txt

% cat data.txt

VGhlIHBhc3N3b3JkIGlzIElGdWt3S0dzRlc4TU9xM0lSRnFyeEUxaHhUTkViVVBSCg==

The password is IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR


Level 11 → Level 12:
--------------------

Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

Commands you may need to solve this level

grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

The password is encoded using simple rot13 encryption. There are many options to solve this including using various scripting languages and simply using an online rot13 decoder. Let’s try a solution in our shell.

% ls

data.txt

% cat data.txt | tr a-zA-Z n-za-mN-ZA-M

The password is 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu


Level 12 → Level 13:
--------------------

Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

Commands you may need to solve this level

grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd, mkdir, cp, mv, file

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it is necessary to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. We need to decompress and check the file over and over again until we get the right format.

Level 13 → Level 14:
--------------------

Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

Commands you may need to solve this level

ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap

This one switches things up a little. The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. We need to borrow an SSH key to move on.
